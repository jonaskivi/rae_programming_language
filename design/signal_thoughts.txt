//Signals syntax uses the func syntax:
	signal (bool result, int other)mouseClicked(ref Tester a_tester, int a_value)

	//Am I wrong if I think that signals can be used in all cases where you'd use a deledate?
	//They work differently, but a signal is just more flexible.
	delegate (bool result, int other)mouseClicked(ref Tester a_tester, int a_value)
