//Signals syntax uses the func syntax:
signal (bool result, int other)mouseClicked(ref Tester a_tester, int a_value)

//Am I wrong if I think that signals can be used in all cases where you'd use a delegate?
//They work differently, but a signal is just more flexible. Signal is kind of like an array of delegates with a single emit.
delegate (bool result, int other)mouseClicked(ref Tester a_tester, int a_value)
